/*   Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, we'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array.

There is a Player class. It has 2 fields: a name String and a score integer.

Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score; 
if 2 or more players have the same score, sort those players alphabetically by name.To do this, we must create a Checker class that implements the Comparator interface,
then write an int compare(Player a, Player b) method implementing the Comparator.compare(T o1, T o2) method.

Input Format :-

Input from stdin is handled by the locked stub code in the Solution class.

The first line contains an integer,n, denoting the number of players.
Each of the n subsequent lines contains a player's name and score, respectively.

Constraints :-

0<=score<=1000
2 players can have the same name.
Player names consist of lowercase English letters.

Output Format :-

The locked stub code in Solution will create a Checker object, use it to sort the Player array, and print each sorted element.

Sample Input :-

5
amy 100
david 100
heraldo 50
aakansha 75
aleksa 150

Sample Output :-

aleksa 150
amy 100
david 100
aakansha 75
heraldo 50               */
